          <h2>Introducing PastaBin</h2>
          PastaBin aims to be an encrypted, modern and fully-featured Pastebin replacement.<br>It has been designed with the following things in mind: Encryption, Simplicity and Elegancy.

          <h2>Free software</h2>
          PastaBin is free software. That's <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">free as in freedom</a>, as well as in price. This means PastaBin is yours — to use, modify, and share — because PastaBin is developed by and for the users.

  		<h2>How does it works?</h2>
  		<p>When you send a paste, PastaBin encrypts it using the password you have given. Then it store the paste id and <strong>encrypted</strong> text of your paste. Their is no password stored in database. When you try to decrypt a paste, PastaBin will check if it's able to decrypt it and return you the decrypted text or an error message it wasn't able to decrypt with the specified password.</p>
  		<p>We could have called this process encryption-over-the-fly, but it would sound too <strong>amazing</strong>.</p>
  		<hr/>
  		<h2>Technologies behind PastaBin</h2>
  		<p>We didn't want to make another PasteBin PHP clone, so we decided to write it in <a href="https://dlang.org">D</a>. The reason for choosing <strong>D</strong> to code this webapp is that it's a nice programming language, running pretty fast, handling MongoDB very well, permiting us to do rapid prototypes and because that's a cool language!</p>
  		<p>Of course, we don't only use D but also ; MongoDB for encrypted data storage, Vibe.D as a webserver and OpenSSL for doing encryption things!</p>
